⚒️ Key Concepts
Amazon S3
A storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data over the internet.

Hosting a Website
Hosting means making your content publicly accessible online.

ACL (Access Control List)
Defines permissions for who can access specific objects within S3.

Static Website Hosting
Amazon S3 can host websites composed of HTML and image files.

🪣 Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Log in to your AWS console
Search for S3
Click Create bucket
Bucket name: XYZ-website-project-YOURNAME
Select your nearest AWS Region
Object Ownership: ACLs enabled
Block Public Access: Unchecked (acknowledge warning)
Bucket Versioning: Enabled
Click Create bucket
💡 S3 bucket names are globally unique. Replace YOURNAME with your name to avoid conflicts.

📁 Step 2: Upload Website Content
Open your bucket
Download and unzip these files:
index.html
XYZ - Everyone...love_files.zip
Go to Objects tab > click Upload
Add index.html and the unzipped folder
Click Upload
💡 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) builds your web pages.

🌐 Step 3: Enable Static Website Hosting
Go to the Properties tab of your bucket
Scroll to Static website hosting > click Edit
Enable Static hosting
Hosting type: Host a static website
Index document: index.html
Save changes
Copy the Bucket website endpoint URL
💡 If you see an error, your files are still private. Proceed to the next step.

🔓 Step 4: Make Objects Public
Go to the Objects tab
Select index.html and the image folder files
Click Actions > Make public using ACL
Now reload your website URL — your static site should be live 🎉
