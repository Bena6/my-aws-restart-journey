Introduction
In this project, I will set up a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) from scratch inside AWS.
A VPC is your own private city in the cloud â€” divided into neighborhoods (subnets) and linked to the outside world (internet gateway).

Therefore I will:

Create a VPC
Set up a public subnet
Attach an internet gateway for external connectivity
